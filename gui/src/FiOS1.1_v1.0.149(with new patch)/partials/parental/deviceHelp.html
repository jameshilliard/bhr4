    <h2>Parental Controls</h2>
  </P>
  
  <P>
The Router provides basic Parental Controls that allow you to create a
list of website addresses and keywords embedded in website addresses
that will limit the computer user's Internet access. Simply follow
the 3 steps below and click the Apply button to set up your Parental
Controls.
</P>
<P>
<em>Note:</em>
While these basic Parental Controls are a great way to limit access
to particular sites, there are other computer software applications
that provide computer Monitoring and computer Content Cleanup.
Monitoring involves keeping records of the computer user's activity
for later review. Content Cleanup involves scanning the actual
content of websites, emails, and attachments for specific words to
block or for spyware, popups, adware, etc.
