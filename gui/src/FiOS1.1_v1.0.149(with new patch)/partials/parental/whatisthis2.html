<h2>Create the Parental Control Rules and Schedules</h2>

<p><strong>What's This</strong></p>

<p><strong>Limit Access by</strong> means you need to choose how to limit access to your
computer(s)/device(s) that you added to the <strong>Selected Devices</strong>
list above. You may limit access by choosing one of the following:
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Block a list of Websites or Embedded Keywords</li>
    <li>Allow a specific list of Websites or Embedded Keywords</li>
    <li>Block ALL Internet access </li>
  </ol>

<p>Blocked or allowed websites are identified either by their specific website address (Example: www.example.com)
<strong>OR</strong> by embedded keywords inside their website address (Example:
"sample" within www.sampleproduct.com).</p>

<P>For example, if you wanted to block www.example.com and all websites with the word "sample" in the website address, you would first click on <strong>Block a list of Websites or Embedded Keywords.</strong> Next, you would type in <strong><em>www.example.com</strong></em> in the "website" list and <strong><em>sample</em></strong> in the <strong>Embedded Keyword within a Website</strong> list.</p>

<p>You may add as many <strong>Website and Embedded Keyword</strong> items as you want simply by typing or pasting each into its <strong>Website or Embedded Keyword field</strong>, one at a time. Click the <strong>Add</strong> button to add each item to your <strong>Blocked
Items</strong> or <strong>Allowed Items</strong> list. If you need help with choosing a list of <strong>Websites or Embedded Keywords</strong> within <strong>Website addresses</strong>, we suggest
searching existing child-friendly sites that contain such lists.</p>

<p> <strong>To Remove a Website or Embedded Keyword from your Blocked Items or
Allowed Items list</strong>, click on the item you wish to remove then click
the <strong>Remove</strong> button. You may remove more than one at a time.</P>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
The router does not block or allow based on content of websites,
emails, or attachments only based on website addresses or keywords
embedded in those website addresses.</p>

<p><em> Note 1:</em> You may find it easier to create a rule to allow a limited
list of known websites than to create rules to block certain websites.</p>

<p><em>Note 2:</em> You can only create one rule for each computer(s)/ device(s).</p>
