<p>{{ message }}<br><br>Enabling DMZ Host is a security risk. When a computer or device on your network is the DMZ Host, it is directly exposed to the Internet and loses much of the protection of the Gateway firewall. If it is compromised, it can also be used to attack other devices on your home network. Click "Enable DMZ Host" to confirm.</p>
